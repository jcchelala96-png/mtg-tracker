3. **Verify Before Starting**
   - Before beginning work, check in with you for plan verification

4. **Execute and Track Progress**

   - Mark them as complete as you go

5. **Communication Style**
   - Provide high level explanations of changes at every step
   - Keep explanations concise and focused

6. **Simplicity Principle**
   - Make every task and code change as simple as possible
   - Avoid massive or complex changes
   - Every change should impact as little code as possible
   - Everything is about simplicity

7. **Final Review**
